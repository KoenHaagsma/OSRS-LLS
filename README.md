## üìñ About the project
My project is about a game I play, the game is called [Old school runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) a MMORPG where you can play with friends and grind for better gameplay. In this game you can also fight bosses with friends, for that purpose I built a live loot splitter, where everyone can fill in the loot that they gathered so it can be evenly split between the teammates that were fighting with you.

### üõ† Built with
The project is built with Socket.io, Javascript, Pug and SCSS

### üåü Features
- Filling in your username, the username is not connected to your account because such an API is non-existent.
- Search for an item that you have redeemed in the boss fight, with the data from my own API the: [OSRS-LLS-API](https://github.com/KoenHaagsma/OSRS-LLS-API)
- Filling in the items that you have redeemed in the boss fight.
- Removing an item if you fill in a wrong item.
- See live price data from the [OSRS real-time prices API](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices)
- See the gold split that is based on the players connected.

### üîÅ API
In this application I used 2 API's, one I created myself and one that was already existing.

#### OSRS LLS API

### üìö Micro libraries
I used one micro library because of not accesible features in the browser on Windows by that i mean the Barcode detector. ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API))
So i searched for another option because i really wanted a barcode scanner in my application, i used [Quagga.js](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/), the documentation is easy to read and also the scanner is easy to use. The experience with this library was good and i would people recommend this scanner, but also it's a pity that i could not use the scanner from JS itself. I hope when i start some other project i can use the native scanner.
